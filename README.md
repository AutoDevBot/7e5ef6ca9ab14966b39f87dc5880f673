monitor-examples
================

We use open source testing frameworks to perform monitoring.  We think this is the best to go instead of developing something new.  We want to use frameworks that you are already familiar and already use so there is no learning curve with using the AutoDevBot monitoring service.

The first testing framework we are supporting is [Frisby.js](http://frisbyjs.com/).  This is a really easy to use framework based on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/) for testing REST APIs.
